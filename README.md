# Just Markdown

You don't need to use a static site generator to benefit from Forestry user interface. Forestry is flexible enough to let you import any repository containing Markdown files, as well as data files: JSON, YAML, TOML.

> It just works.

## Forestry CMS

[Forestry](https://forestry.io) is a git-based CMS. Once connected to your Git provider, it will commit back changes to your repository.

We don't store your content, _you_ do.

### Features

* Import many **branches**
* **Instant Preview** environment with pre-defined settings for most common static site generators: Gatsby, Hugo, Jekyll, Eleventy, Gridsome, Next, Nuxt, VuePress etc.
* **Organizations**, teams and collaborators
* **Customizable sidebar**: define content and data sections for your editorial team
* Front Matter Templates: create **content models** from existing documents to ease the creation of new documents

## Get started

* [Pick up one of our demo starter](https://forestry.io/starters)
* Pick up a [Stackbit](https://stackbit.com) theme
